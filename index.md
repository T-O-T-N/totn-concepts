## Welcome to TOTN Concepts! ❤️

### What is it about?

Here, I write about the concepts that are not big enough to be converted into a video, but worth knowing about.

If there are some code snippets that I got to share with you, they would be appended here as well, something like this!

```js
const hello_world = () => {
	console.log('Hello World');
};

let first = 10;
let second = 20;

console.log("First + Second: ", (first + second));
```
